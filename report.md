# Code Analysis Report

## Critical Issues

### 1. Task System Reward Bug
The main issue with tasks not rewarding is in the `TasksPage` component and `useTaskSystem` hook:

- The task completion flow doesn't properly connect to the reward system
- `claimReward` is never called after task completion
- No proper connection between `completeTask` and `claimReward` functions

### 2. Implementation Gaps

#### Task System
- No proper task completion verification
- Missing server-side validation for task completion
- Telegram/Twitter verification not implemented
- Task state persists locally without proper validation

#### Task Reward Flow
```typescript
// Current flow (broken):
completeTask -> showConfirm -> sets completed = true -> stops

// Should be:
completeTask -> showConfirm -> sets completed = true -> triggers reward claim -> adds miner
```

### 3. Code Structure Issues

#### Circular Dependencies
- Potential circular dependency between game state and task system
- `useGameState` and `useTaskSystem` hooks have indirect dependencies

#### State Management
- Local storage used for critical game data without validation
- No backup/recovery system for corrupted states
- Missing error boundaries

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Task Reward System
```typescript
// In TaskCard component, modify onTaskClick:
const handleTaskClick = async (task: Task) => {
  if (!task.completed) {
    const completed = await completeTask(task.id);
    if (completed) {
      const rewardMiner = claimReward(task.id);
      if (rewardMiner) {
        addStoredMiner(rewardMiner);
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Implement Proper Verification
- Add server-side validation for task completion
- Implement proper social media verification
- Add task completion timestamps

### 3. Improve Error Handling
- Add error boundaries
- Implement state recovery
- Add validation for local storage data

### 4. State Management
- Consider using a proper state management solution
- Implement proper data persistence
- Add state validation

## Security Concerns
- Local storage manipulation possible
- No verification for task completion
- Missing rate limiting for task completion

## Performance Issues
- Frequent local storage operations
- Multiple re-renders in task system
- Inefficient state updates

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper task completion flow
2. Add verification system
3. Improve state management
4. Add proper error handling
5. Implement security measures
